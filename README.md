Project Overview
This project implements a Transformer-based model for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as language translation. The Transformer model, introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need", utilizes self-attention mechanisms to efficiently model long-range dependencies in sequential data. In this repository, the model has been customized to handle translation tasks, converting input sequences in one language to output sequences in another. The pipeline includes data tokenization, positional encoding, multi-head attention, and feed-forward layers, ensuring accurate sequence modeling. Users can train the model on their datasets, save checkpoints, and load pre-trained models for inference, making this a versatile solution for translation or similar sequence tasks.
